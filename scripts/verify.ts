/**
 * Single verification entry point for this repository (`bun run verify`).
 *
 * Runs the gates a change must pass before it counts as done, in a fixed order:
 * `docs` (the agent contract stays within its size cap and the docs index is
 * complete) -> `agent-safety` (the workspace-scoped delete helper's refusals) ->
 * `migrations` (the generated chain matches `drizzle/`) -> `lint` (oxlint) ->
 * `typecheck` (tsc --noEmit in every package) -> `test` (Vitest on Bun, every
 * project in `vitest.config.ts`).
 * Every selected gate always runs — an incomplete picture costs more than the
 * extra seconds — and each one streams its own output, so a failure can be read
 * in place.
 *
 * Read the summary at the end first: it names the failing gates and sets a
 * non-zero exit code, which makes this command usable as a CI gate as well.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run verify                 # default gates: docs, agent-safety, migrations, lint, typecheck, test
 *   bun run verify test            # only the named gates
 *   bun run verify format          # opt-in gates (formatting)
 *   bun run verify obsidian        # end-to-end against a real running Obsidian
 *   bun run verify obsidian-ci     # same suite, rendered-geometry cases skipped (CI)
 *
 * Gates: docs (AGENTS.md cap + docs index/links), agent-safety (the delete
 * helper's refusals and recursive removal), migrations (the generated chain), lint,
 * typecheck, test, format (`oxfmt --check`), coverage (the per-package ratchet),
 * obsidian (real Obsidian over the official CLI), obsidian-ci (the same suite
 * without the cases that read rendered geometry).
