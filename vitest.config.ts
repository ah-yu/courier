 * The suite runs on `bun --bun vitest` (see `package.json`): Vitest is the runner, Bun

 * and start a real `Bun.serve`, so a Node runtime cannot run them; and Vitest is what
 * gives this repository statement, branch, function and line coverage (Bun's own
 * reporter has only the last two) plus Stryker's test runner for mutation surveys.
 *
 * `--bun` matters: without it Bun runs the Vitest CLI under Node, where `bun:sqlite`
 * does not exist.

     * else green). The thresholds below are the floor the repository commits to: a module
     * that lands without tests moves its package's number down and fails.

     * They are a **ratchet, not a target** — pinned at, or a point or two below, what each
     * package actually reaches, so ordinary churn does not fail and nothing is gained by
     * chasing a number. **Raise them when a package improves; never lower one to make a
     * change pass** — and if a package genuinely cannot hold its number, the commit says
     * which branch the drop came from and why that branch is not testable (see
     * `docs/mutation-testing.md` for the branches that are defensive by construction: the
     * floor is not the place to fight for them).
