 * The records that let the engine recognise its own events.

 * The clock is injected, so these cases move time instead of freezing a global `Date`
 * (which is what the engine's own tests had to do before this module existed). What
 * matters is that every record is **narrow**: a write matches on content, a rename on
 * its target, and a delete is consumed once — so a genuine user action that lands
 * inside a window is still handled as one.
