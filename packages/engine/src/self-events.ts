 * The events a sync engine has to recognise as **its own**.
 *
 * Every local write, delete or move the engine performs comes back to it as a vault
 * event (the adapter fires it, and the host feeds it straight back in), and every push
 * comes back as a `file_pushed` echo from the server. Treating any of them as a user
 * action is how a pull pushed its own result back under a second fileId, how applying a
 * peer's delete pushed a second tombstone (which made the file unrestorable), and how
 * following a peer's move pushed a second `rename` version.
 *
 * The records are **time-bounded hints**, not a mute switch: a write is matched by
 * content hash (a genuine edit that lands in the window has different bytes), a rename
 * by its target, and a delete by path. The window only has to outlive the event it
 * exists for, and it is swept as records are added, so a host that stays up for weeks
 * does not accumulate them. The clock is injected so a test can move it instead of
 * freezing a global.
