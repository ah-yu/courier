/**
 * A bounded pool for the work **inside** one pass.
 *
 * The host already bounds event-driven work with `OpQueue`; a full reconcile was
 * serial for a different reason (it decides from one snapshot and pushes as it goes),
 * and that reason does not require one file at a time: every item the pass schedules is
 * a different fileId, so the state mutations it makes are disjoint. What serialising
 * did cost is the network: a cold start pulled one file per round trip, which on a
 * phone is the whole latency of the sync.
 *
 * Paths are not always disjoint even when fileIds are: a peer's move can leave two
 * chains naming one path for a moment. `SyncEngine` serialises those through
 * `PathClaims`; this pool only bounds how many may run.
 *
 * This is the awaitable half of the same policy `OpQueue` implements for events:
 *
 * - at most `maxConcurrent` small operations run at once;
 * - an operation at or above `exclusiveBytes` runs alone, and — because the queue is
 *   FIFO — also holds back the small operations behind it, so a steady stream of notes
 *   cannot starve a large attachment;
 * - nothing here decides *what* to do with a file; the pool only decides how many of
 *   the pass's per-file operations may be in flight. The engine's no-lock rule (nothing
 *   ever waits on a path) is untouched: a pool slot never waits on another slot.
