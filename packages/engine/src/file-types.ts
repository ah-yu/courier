/**
 * Which **kinds of file** a device syncs, and the extension table that decides it.
 *
 * Markdown (`.md`) and JSON Canvas (`.canvas`) are synced on every device and have
 * no switch: they are the vault's content, and a device that cannot see them is
 * looking at a different vault. Everything else is grouped the way Obsidian's own
 * documentation groups its supported file types, so a user can turn off exactly the
 * category they do not want on another device (a phone that should not pull 4K video,
 * say) instead of all of them at once:
 *
 * - `images` / `audio` / `video` / `pdf` — on by default.
 * - `otherTypes` — everything the tables below do not claim (`.base`, `.excalidraw`,
 *   archives, an extensionless tool file, …), off by default because its provenance
 *   cannot be reasoned about.
 *
 * The table is the one reason this module is separate from `sync-scope.ts`: the scope
 * decides *which paths* sync (config-folder groups, hidden names, the size cap), this
 * decides *what kind of thing* a vault path is.
