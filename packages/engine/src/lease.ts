/**
 * One writer per vault.
 *
 * The plugin and the headless CLI run the same engine against the same local folder, so
 * two active hosts would decide from separate snapshots and race: conflict copies at
 * best, a lost write at worst. Observing the other application is not enough — a file
 * change is delivered *after* the other host may already have started, and a config file
 * can be read half-written. Correctness therefore comes from an **atomic lease both hosts
 * take before they build a host**, not from how quickly one notices the other.
 *
 * The lease is a directory under the vault (`.courier/sync-lease`): creating a directory
 * is atomic on the filesystems both hosts support, so exactly one `mkdir` wins. Inside it,
 * `owner.json` names the holder and is written **once**; a per-token heartbeat file is the
 * only thing renewal rewrites. The split matters: a process suspended past its TTL can
 * resume and touch its own heartbeat inside a directory a contender has since taken over,
 * but it can no longer overwrite the new owner record. The stale directory is renamed aside
 * first so two contenders cannot both remove and recreate it.
 *
 * A host that cannot acquire the lease **must not start its engine**. It waits and retries;
 * Obsidian's state is reporting context only, never a handoff rule.

 * every exit: a supervisor stops the CLI by ending the process (Windows has no
 * deliverable signal), and Obsidian quits without waiting for a plugin's asynchronous
 * release to finish. In both cases the holder's record outlives it by up to the TTL, and
 * without this check every reader — the page, the other application waiting for the vault,
 * a restart — described a process that no longer exists as the writer for seconds.
 *
 * A plugin lease belongs to the **renderer** that wrote it: that process dies with its
 * window (or the whole app), and no other window holds that token, so its pid is evidence
 * in the same way a CLI process's is.
 *
 * The check is deliberately **local**: a pid only names a process on the machine that wrote
 * the record. A vault folder reachable from two machines (a shared folder, not a synced
 * one) would otherwise let one declare the other's live holder dead by looking up a pid
 * that belongs to a different process table — the one way this optimisation could produce
 * the race the lease exists to prevent. Without a host on both sides, or without a pid
 * (a platform with no process table, such as mobile), only expiry decides.
