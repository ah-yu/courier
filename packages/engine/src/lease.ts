/**
 * One writer per vault.
 *
 * The plugin and the headless CLI run the same engine against the same local folder, so
 * two active hosts would decide from separate snapshots and race: conflict copies at
 * best, a lost write at worst. Observing the other application is not enough — a file
 * change is delivered *after* the other host may already have started, and a config file
 * can be read half-written. Correctness therefore comes from an **atomic lease both hosts
 * take before they build a host**, not from how quickly one notices the other.
 *
 * The lease is a directory under the vault (`.courier/sync-lease`): creating a directory
 * is atomic on the filesystems both hosts support, so exactly one `mkdir` wins. Inside it,
 * `owner.json` names the holder and is written **once**; a per-token heartbeat file is the
 * only thing renewal rewrites. The split matters: a process suspended past its TTL can
 * resume and touch its own heartbeat inside a directory a contender has since taken over,
 * but it can no longer overwrite the new owner record. The stale directory is renamed aside
 * first so two contenders cannot both remove and recreate it.
 *
 * A host that cannot acquire the lease **must not start its engine**. It waits and retries;
 * Obsidian's state is reporting context only, never a handoff rule.
