 *
 * Two fields carry the weight here:
 *
 * - `content` is `null` for a version that has no payload to send: a `delete`, or a
 *   `rename` whose bytes the store already holds under `contentHash` (the engine's
 *   rename rule — a move costs one small request, not a second upload of the file).
 * - `sizeBytes` is the **plaintext** size of the version even when `content` is
 *   null: it plans the chunked transfer and the progress report. It does not decide
 *   whether a peer downloads the version — the cap bounds uploads only.
