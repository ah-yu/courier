/**
 * The host loop both clients run: bind, watch, subscribe, reconcile, poll, stop.
 *
 * It used to exist twice — `EngineHost` in the plugin and `runDaemon` in the CLI —
 * and the copies had already drifted (the CLI never stopped on a revoked key, and
 * read its settings-poll failure flag from a second copy of the same code). Every
 * rule in here is one of the ones the e2e suites exist to protect:
 *
 * - the **bind pass** is the host's first look at a vault (`firstBind`), and a
 *   pass that has never completed one must still be a bind — the other direction
 *   deletes notes;
 * - a reconcile is **never re-entered** (it decides from a snapshot and pushes as
 *   it goes, so two at once duplicate versions), and it runs on a **re**connect,
 *   never on the first connect (which sits right behind the bind pass);
 * - the config folder fires no events, so a settings change needs its own **poll**,
 *   and a poll that fails every 30 seconds reports once, not 120 times an hour;
 * - event-driven work goes through an **`OpQueue`**, because a folder dropped into
 *   a vault arrives as one synchronous event per file;
 * - a bind pass that fails leaves a **fully wired** host that retries, rather than
 *   a half-built one whose only way back is a setting the user has to guess at.
 *
 * What is *not* here is anything host-specific: where events come from (Obsidian's
 * vault, Bun's `fs.watch`), how state is persisted (plugin `data.json`, the CLI's
 * `sync_state.json`), how the network is built (`requestUrl`, `fetch`) and what a
 * log line looks like. Those are injected.
