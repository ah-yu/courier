/**
 * Conflict files — where the losing side of an auto-resolved conflict is parked.
 *
 * A vault-file conflict resolves the same way on every host: the **remote head becomes
 * the truth** and whatever this device had locally is written beside the file as
 * `{stem}-{YYYY-MM-DD-HHmmss}.conflict{ext}` — `note-2026-02-14-101530.conflict.md`
 * for a note, `photo-2026-02-14-101530.conflict.png` for an image, so the parked copy
 * keeps the extension Obsidian needs to open it at all.
 *
 * A path inside Obsidian's config folder is the exception: a copy parked there is
 * outside the vault index, so nobody could see or act on it. Those conflicts are
 * settled by last modification time and park nothing (`handleConflict`).
 *
 * Those files are never synced. They are the local audit trail of a conflict —
 * letting them travel would let one conflict produce another on the peer.
