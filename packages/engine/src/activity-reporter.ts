 * UI convenience, and the "once per pass" bookkeeping (which paths were already reported) is
 * state that a pass owns, not state a chain owns.
 *
 * Two of the five callbacks are isolated, because they are pure convenience and a host bug
 * must not cost a sync: `onSyncActivity` and `onProgress` swallow a throwing listener (and
 * log the first). The three notices — `onFileTooLarge`, `onFileSkipped`, `onSettingsApplied` —
 * are called directly, so a host that throws there fails the pass exactly as it did before
 * this class existed; changing that would be a host-contract change, not a refactor.
