/**
 * The host-facing admin API: everything an operator can learn **in-band**, over
 * HTTP, from the process that owns the answer.
 *
 * Two deliberately separate reads, because they have different costs:
 *
 *   - `GET /api/admin/runtime` is cheap and is polled: what this process consumes
 *     right now, what the machine looks like, who is subscribed.
 *   - `GET /api/admin/status` walks the blob store (cached for a short window)
 *     and reads the database: storage, counts, and the migration pair.
 *
 * What is **not** here, on purpose: whether the service runs, how often systemd
 * restarted it, why it stopped, its journal, and the installed binary's checksum.
 * A process cannot answer for its own death, so the operator asks systemd over SSH
 * — and only when this API does not answer.
 *
 * The migration pair comes from `db/migrations.ts`: the chain is a plain array in
 * the bundle, so a Vite-processed consumer (the `packages/e2e` suite boots this
 * app) reads the same numbers the binary reports.
