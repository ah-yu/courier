 *
 * - **the chain order** is `(created_at, rowid)`, oldest first. `created_at` is
 *   millisecond ISO text, so two pushes in the same instant are ordered by
 *   `rowid`; every reader of "the head" — the conditional insert, the push
 *   pre-check, the pull, retention pruning — has to agree, or a client whose
 *   `baseVersionId` came from one of them is refused forever by another.
 * - **the conditional insert is one transaction per batch**, because the blob writes
 *   between the handler's pre-check and the insert are real asynchronous I/O (see
 *   {@link TryInsertFileVersionsFn}).
