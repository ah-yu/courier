/**
 * The contract generation: the one number a client and a server must agree on.
 *
 * Three packages ship from one tag, but they are upgraded at different times: the plugin
 * follows the Obsidian directory (a user may keep an old build for months), the CLI is a
 * binary someone installed once, and the server is whatever an administrator has deployed.
 * A release being atomic therefore says nothing about a **deployment**. These constants are
 * how a client and a server that meet by chance decide whether they can work together, and
 * which side is the one that has to move.
 *
 * Two numbers, and two questions:
 *
 * - `CONTRACT_GENERATION` — the interface generation this build speaks. A client states it
 *   on every request (`X-Courier-Contract`), a server publishes it on `/api/health`. A
 *   **client needs a server at its own generation or newer**: an older server cannot read a
 *   newer client's requests, and the server refuses one above its own generation, so a
 *   client that accepted an older server would only collect `426`s.
 * - `MIN_CLIENT_CONTRACT` — the server's floor: the oldest client generation it still
 *   serves. This is the number that keeps one server serving the several plugin versions
 *   its users are running, because an additive release leaves it where it was.
 *
 * The rules for moving them, in full:
 *
 * | The release changes...                                                              | CONTRACT_GENERATION | MIN_CLIENT_CONTRACT |
 * | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
 * | something an older peer misreads (removed field, changed meaning, new required field) | +1                  | new generation      |
 * | something additive only (new optional field, new route, new error code)              | +1                  | unchanged           |
 * | the server stops reading older clients (fields dropped, framing changed)             | +1                  | new generation      |
 *
 * The single judgement behind every row: **would the old side misread this byte?** `bun run
 * contract` decides the row for everything the types can show (a field added, removed, made
 * required, retyped; a route removed; a member of an `as const` set added or removed) and
 * prints the values to write. What it cannot see is a field whose *name and type stayed the
 * same but whose meaning changed* — that one is answered by the same question, by hand.
 *
 * `bun run verify` fails while the code's observable surface differs from
 * `packages/shared/contract/<CONTRACT_GENERATION>.surface.json`, so a change cannot land
 * without this file being considered.
 *
 * See `docs/api.md` → "Contract generation".

 * not change meaning; the gate now sees request constraints, status codes, auth and the
 * WebSocket frames the declaration scan could not. Generation 5 records the 426 body's

 * predates it ignores the frame (its dispatcher has no case for it) and its periodic
 * reconcile covers the missed push, which is a degradation, not a corruption. Adding a
