/**
 * The daemon's event source: `fs.watch`, coalesced, turned into the host's
 * three-way handler set.
 *
 * The coalescing is deliberate. `fs.watch` reports "something happened to this
 * path" — several times per write, and with no distinction between a create, a
 * modify, a delete or a rename — so a burst is collected for
 * {@link WATCH_DEBOUNCE_MS} and each path is then answered by reading it: a file
 * that exists is a change, one that does not is a removal. That read is also what
 * makes the answer honest rather than a guess.
 *
 * A folder the scope cannot sync is dropped here, with the same predicate the
 * engine applies to a listing.
