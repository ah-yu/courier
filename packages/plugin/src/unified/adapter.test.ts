 * `racedFolders` makes `createFolder` behave exactly like that loser (create it, then
 * throw), and `uncreatableFolders` models a genuine failure (nothing is created, the
 * error is the truth). `createBinary` also refuses an existing path, after an await —
 * the window in which a concurrent write can win the same path. The data adapter
 * underneath shares the same byte store but does *not* report into the vault index
