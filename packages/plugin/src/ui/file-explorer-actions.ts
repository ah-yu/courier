/**
 * The two actions a file-explorer row can carry, next to its name.
 *
 * **Desktop only** — `main.ts` installs this only when `Platform.isDesktop`, because hover is
 * a pointer gesture and the surfaces behind the chips are wide. Obsidian has no public
 * per-file hook for its file explorer, so the rows are decorated by watching the explorer's
 * DOM: a chip is added to every `.nav-file-title[data-path]`, and a `MutationObserver` keeps
 * up with the explorer rebuilding its rows (a new file, a folder expanded, another window
 * opened). The failure mode is deliberately "no button": if the selector ever stops matching,
 * nothing is injected and nothing throws — the version history stays reachable from the
 * file's own context menu, which is public API (`main.ts` registers it on `file-menu`).
 *
 * Two chips, one per kind of row:
 *
 * - a **parked conflict copy** gets its own action (`对比` / `替换`), because a copy has no
 *   chain at all — offering history for it would open a view that could only say "no
 *   versions";
 * - every **other file** gets `版本历史`. That is the desktop entry point: the app's own
 *   "Version history" context-menu item sits on the same file, and a hover chip on the row
 *   is the one that is not mistaken for it.
 *
 * Neither chip is offered on a file under an **excluded folder**: the folder is outside this
 * device's scope, so the chips follow the scope rather than the file. A chain this device had
 * before the folder was excluded is kept (the engine parks the file there and says so in
 * `docs/sync-scope.md`) and a copy parked before the exclusion is still on disk — neither is
 * offered from here, deliberately. {@link fileActionFor} is the rule, shared with the file
 * menu.
