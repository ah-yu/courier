/**
 * A storage row's content: a quota bar followed by `used/limit`.
 *
 * Shared by the status menu and the settings page, so both show the same reading. A
 * `DocumentFragment` lets either host carry the bar without replacing its own row; the
 * fallback string is for a host without a DOM (the e2e harness), where `document` does
 * not exist. The real app always takes the fragment path — including for an unlimited
 * account or a failed read, which have no bar to draw but still need the row wrapper the
 * menu styles: a bare string would fall back to Obsidian's larger, muted `is-label`
 * typography instead of matching the rows around it.
