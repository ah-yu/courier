 * Reject when `promise` has not settled within `timeoutMs`.
 *
 * The status menu reads the account before it opens, and a request that never settles
 * would leave the user staring at an icon that did nothing. The timeout does not cancel
 * the underlying request (the shared client takes no abort signal); it only lets the menu
 * fall back to what it already knows. The timer is cleared on either settlement, so a
 * successful read leaves nothing behind.
