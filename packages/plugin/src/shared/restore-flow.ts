 * would write to is *not* free: the engine refuses to overwrite it
 * (`RestoreBlockedError`), and the answer is a dialog that asks for another file
 * name — pre-filled with the original name plus `-1`, the way a person would name a
 * second copy — so the content comes back beside the file that took the path.
 * Restoring onto the chain's own file, by contrast, is a plain write — optionally
 * gated by a confirmation, because it replaces content the user can still see.
