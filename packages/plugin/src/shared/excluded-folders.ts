 * The folder tree behind the settings page's "manage excluded folders" dialog.

 * Kept pure (no `obsidian` import) so the decisions the dialog makes — what a checkbox
 * means when an ancestor is excluded, what "Done" should save, and how a flat list of
 * folder paths becomes a tree — are unit-tested instead of being asserted through a
 * fake modal.
 *
 * The engine's excluded-folder rule is a path prefix (`path === folder ||
 * path.startsWith(folder + "/")`), so an exclusion of `projects` already covers
 * `projects/create NFT's`. The dialog makes that hierarchy visible: a child of an
 * excluded folder is shown checked and disabled, because unchecking it alone could not
 * bring it back — the parent has to be unchecked first.
