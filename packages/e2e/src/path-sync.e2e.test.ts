/**
 * End-to-end sync across **file path shapes**: root, one level deep, two levels
 * deep and a deep chain, for every basic operation (create, modify, delete,
 * rename) plus renames that change the folder.
 *
 * This is deliberately a separate file from `sync.e2e.test.ts`: that one tells
 * the story of the sync features (conflict policies, the recycle bin, device
 * attribution, websocket delivery) with one path shape; this one holds the path
 * shape constant per case so a failure names the operation *and* the shape.
 *
 * Nothing is mocked: real server (SQLite + Hono + ws), real `SyncEngine`, real
 * `FsAdapter` over a temp directory. Path semantics cannot be pinned in the
 * engine's own unit tests — its `FakeAdapter` is a flat `Map` with a no-op
 * `createFolder` — which is why nesting is verified here and in the adapters'
 * own unit tests.
