/**
 * Thin wrapper around the **official Obsidian CLI**
 * (https://help.obsidian.md/cli), which is how the end-to-end tests drive a
 * real, running Obsidian — two vaults at once, addressed with `vault=<name>`.
 *
 * Why the CLI instead of screenshots or DOM poking: the CLI exposes
 * `eval code="<js>"`, which runs JavaScript inside the vault's renderer. That
 * gives the tests the real `app.vault` API (so writes go through Obsidian's own
 * file layer and produce real vault events) and the real plugin instance
 * (`app.plugins.plugins.courier`), with assertions made on values rather than
 * pixels.
 *
 * **All calls are asynchronous on purpose.** The test server runs inside the
 * same process as the suite, so a synchronous `spawnSync` would block the
 * event loop and deadlock the very HTTP request the evaluated code is waiting
 * on.
 *
 * Notes learned from probing the CLI:
 *   - `eval` **awaits promises** and prints the resolved value after `=> `.
 *   - A vault with no window is still addressable; the CLI brings its context up
 *     on demand, so both test vaults can be driven without opening windows.
 *   - The `create` command resolves its target folder from the *active file*,
 *     which is null in a windowless vault — so writes go through `app.vault.*`
 *     inside `eval` instead.
