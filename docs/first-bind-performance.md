# First bind of a large local vault: measured cost and limits

Status: research measurement, recorded 2026-10-26. The **before** numbers are commit `cc395e2`; the
fixes described below are on the same branch as this document.

**Question.** A user already has a big vault on disk (thousands of notes, years of history) and connects
it to a remote vault for the first time. What does that first pass cost, and is it acceptable?

**Answer.** The pass is linear in the vault and, on a healthy server, cheap enough:

| Vault        | Upload bind (empty remote) | First download (empty local vault) | Steady state afterwards |
| ------------ | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 10 000 files | **16.6 s**                 | 28 s                               | 0.6 s per pass          |
| 12 500 files | 23.6 s, one pass           | —                                  | 0.8 s per pass          |
| 50 000 files | **82.9 s** (115 MiB)       | **140.9 s** (115 MiB)              | 8.4 s per pass          |

Per-file cost is ~1.7 ms up and ~2.8 ms down on this machine (localhost, WAL, four concurrent small
files). The upload number is about twice as fast as the earlier measurement because batch preparation and
the request now overlap; the download is dominated by one content request plus one write per file, not by
a limit.

Before the fixes the same 10 000-file bind took 28.1 s, a 12 500-file vault **failed** after 33 s and
needed ~25 minutes of five-minute retries to finish, a 50 000-file bind needed ~26 hours of extrapolated
retries, and a 10 000-file download reported success with 8 000 files missing. Those defects — and what
was done about them — are the record below.

## Empty local vault, large remote

The other direction of the same first connect: this device has nothing, the remote holds the vault. It is
one content request per file (content addressing has nothing to batch at the route level), pulled four at
a time by the pass's `WorkPool`.

| 50 000 files, 115 MiB | Before                                                                                        | After                               |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Wall time             | 141.6 s for 45 778 files, then a **failed pass**, then 20.8 s for the rest (~162 s, 2 passes) | **140.9 s, 50 001 files, one pass** |
| Result                | the transfer limit cut the pass off mid-vault                                                 | no errors; `filesOnDisk` 50 001     |
| Second pass           | 20.8 s (the remainder)                                                                        | 8.4 s (index + stamps, no reads)    |

Two things changed: the transfer allowance is now sized for a download (60 000/min, so the limiter stops
being the ceiling at this size), and a refused content read **waits out the window** instead of failing
the pass. What remains is the per-file pipeline — one request, one decrypt, one write, one stat, four at
a time — which is why 50 000 files settle at ~2.8 ms each. A batch content route (N hashes per request)
or higher per-pass concurrency is the next lever; neither is needed to _finish_, which is what the
failure used to prevent.

## Method

Real code only: the real `SyncEngine`, the real CLI `FsAdapter`, and a real server (SQLite + `Bun.serve` +
ws). The synthetic vault is 40 folders of 0.8–4 KiB notes plus one 1 MiB attachment (a typical note
vault's shape). Everything ran on one Windows machine with the server on `127.0.0.1`, so **network
latency is absent** and the numbers below are optimistic for a deployed server; the Obsidian adapter
(`readBinary` over Electron IPC) is also slower than `fs.readFile`, so the local half is optimistic as
well. The database is in WAL mode, which is what `courier migrate` does in production; the e2e harness's
own schema setup leaves SQLite's default rollback journal, where the same bind is ~1.6× slower.

Two opt-in benchmarks (`COURIER_BENCH=1`):

| File                                                        | What it measures                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `packages/e2e/src/research/first-bind.bench.test.ts`        | upload bind, steady-state pass, download bind                              |
| `packages/e2e/src/research/first-bind-limits.bench.test.ts` | server marginal cost, the deployed limiters, a bind larger than one window |

```bash
COURIER_BENCH=1 COURIER_BENCH_WAL=1 COURIER_BENCH_FILES=10000 \
  bun --bun vitest run packages/e2e/src/research/first-bind.bench.test.ts
COURIER_BENCH=1 COURIER_BENCH_FILES=12500 \
  bun --bun vitest run packages/e2e/src/research/first-bind-limits.bench.test.ts
```

The refused-batch reproduction that used to sit beside them was removed once the fix landed: what it
measured — one refused batch costs one batch, not the rest of the pass — is pinned by the `a first bind
that meets the server's limits` cases in `packages/engine/src/engine.test.ts`, which run in the default
gate instead of behind `COURIER_BENCH`.

## Where a first bind spends its time

A bind of 10 001 files (23.9 MiB) against an empty remote, after the fixes:

| Phase                                       | Measured   | Notes                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| local scan (`stat` + hash of claimed files) | 0.4 s      | 10 001 reads; unclaimed files are read by the create instead |
| 101 push requests (100 files each)          | 16.1 s     | 1.7 ms/file over loopback, prepared while the previous flies |
| index and bookkeeping                       | ~0.5 s     | one `GET /sync/index`                                        |
| **total**                                   | **16.6 s** | 1.7 ms/file                                                  |

At 50 000 files the same push phase is 79.4 s (1.6 ms/file) — the per-batch time stays flat from batch 1
to batch 500, which is what says the pass is linear rather than quadratic.

The server's own marginal cost, measured directly (100-file batches, WAL):

| 100-file batch                         | Before | After     |
| -------------------------------------- | ------ | --------- |
| 100 distinct payloads (blob + row)     | 132 ms | **52 ms** |
| 100 files sharing one blob (rows only) | 115 ms | 41 ms     |
| 100 tombstones (rows only)             | 89 ms  | 21 ms     |

That drop is the batch transaction: 100 commits (each an fsync) became one.

A second pass over the same vault costs 0.6 s (0.06 ms/file): every stamp still matches, so nothing is
read and nothing is pushed.

### Download (an empty device meets a full remote)

| Scenario     | Before                                   | After                                |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 2 000 files  | 4.9 s, all landed                        | 4.9 s, all landed                    |
| 10 000 files | 35.1 s, **2 000 landed, `error: null`**  | **27.9 s, 10 001 landed, no errors** |
| 50 000 files | ~162 s over two passes, first one failed | **140.9 s, one pass**                |

One request per remote file, so the transfer allowance used to be the ceiling (2 000/min). It is now
60 000/min — above what the per-file pipeline can use — and a refusal is waited out instead of ending the
pass.

## The three cliffs (before the fixes)

These are the defects the measurement found; each was reproduced, then fixed, and each fix has a test.

### 1. A refusal dropped every later batch, and stranded its files

`createUntrackedFiles` flushed with `firstFailure ??= await flush()`. `??=` does not evaluate its
right-hand side once `firstFailure` is set, so after the first refusal **no further batch was sent** —
while the loop kept reading, encrypting and recording every remaining file in `this.state` with no
version. Measured: 251 files, first batch refused → `batchesAttempted: [100]`, `stateEntries: 251`,
`stateEntriesWithoutVersion: 251`.

Those phantom entries then made the next pass push the files **one request per file** (201 files = 201
requests, 119 accepted before the limiter refused again). Recovery was therefore limited by the request
budget, not by bandwidth, and the plugin retried every five minutes: a 20 000-file vault needed ~5.5
hours, a 50 000-file one ~26 hours.

### 2. Rate limits were request-based and sized for steady state

| Limiter  | Before    | Applied to                                    | Bind cost                     |
| -------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `sync`   | 120/min   | push, pull, index, versions, history, deleted | 1 request per 100 local files |
| transfer | 2 000/min | version content, chunk staging                | 1 request per remote file     |

A 12 101-file bind measured: 120 pushes (12 000 files) in 29 s, the 121st refused, the bind failed at
33 s. A 10 000-file download was cut off at 2 000 files. No client code read `Retry-After` or retried a
429; the server did not send one.

### 3. A refused pull looked exactly like a missing blob

`fetchRemoteBytes` caught **every** error and answered "content unavailable", and the reconcile tolerated
that answer. So a 429 (or a 5xx, or a dropped connection) during a first download made the pass report
success while the device stayed incomplete — the 10 000-file case above.

## What changed

**Engine**

- The batch flush is always awaited (`const failure = await flush(); firstFailure ??= failure;`), so a
  refused batch costs one batch, not the rest of the pass.
- A refused create **drops its pending state entry** (`dropPendingCreate`): the file is untracked again and
  the next pass retries it through the batched create path (100 files per request instead of 1). Only the
  pending shape is dropped, so a version a concurrent event pushed in the meantime survives.
- A `429` is **waited out** (`withRateLimitWaits`, using the server's `Retry-After`), and the same batch
  is re-sent; only after `MAX_RATE_LIMIT_WAITS` does the pass stop and leave the rest untracked. The wait
  applies to single-file pushes **and to content reads**, so a large first download waits instead of
  failing.
- **Preparation and the request overlap**: a full batch is handed to the wire and the next one is read,
  hashed and encrypted while it flies. At most one batch is in flight and one is being built; a large file
  still travels alone and a chunked upload still runs without another request interleaved.
- A pass reports **progress** (`SyncProgress{done,total}`, coarse steps plus one report at the end);
  `SyncHost.binding` says whether it is still the first pass and `SyncHost.firstSync` additionally
  requires that no bind ever completed (a flag the host persists beside the per-file state), so a bind
  killed half-way keeps its counter on the next start. The plugin shows it in the status bar's tooltip
  and counts a bind as `syncing`; the CLI logs a line per tenth.
- A wait is **reported** (`onRateLimited`), so a pass that sits out a limiter window is not mistaken for a
  hang: the CLI logs it, the plugin says it on the console.
- The pull path distinguishes "the store holds nothing" (`404`, undecryptable) from "the request did not
  happen" (`429`, `5xx`, transport): the first is tolerated as before, the second **fails the pass** so
  the host retries it and the user sees it.
- The scan fetches the sync index **first** and hashes only files a chain or a state entry can claim; the
  rest are read once, by the create that needs the bytes anyway. A first bind reads the vault once
  instead of twice.
- The scan's per-file work runs through `WorkPool` (4 at a time) instead of one serial await per file.
- A failed bind is retried by the host on its own backoff (30 s → 60 s → … → the reconcile interval)
  instead of waiting for the five-minute periodic pass.

**Server**

- `tryInsertFileVersions`: one transaction for a whole push batch, still checking each row's chain head
  inside it. ~0.9 ms of fsync per file became one commit per 100 files.
- Rate limits raised to 600/min (sync) and 60 000/min (transfer), sized for a bind; a 429 now carries a
  standard `Retry-After`.
- The shared HTTP client surfaces `retryAfterMs` on `ApiClientError`, read from `Retry-After`.

**Docs**: [sync-engine.md](sync-engine.md) (batching, pipelining, progress, pull failures, read-once,
host retry), [api.md](api.md) (rate limits, `Retry-After`), [server.md](server.md) (the batch
transaction), [plugin.md](plugin.md) (the status bar's first-sync state), [cli.md](cli.md) (the progress
line).

## Verdict

- **Up to ~20 000 files, healthy server:** a first connect is a one-off 15–75 s locally, and roughly two
  to three times that over a real network (upload bandwidth and per-batch RTT). Acceptable.
- **Tens of thousands of files:** linear — 50 001 files is 501 pushes in 83 s, inside the 600/min
  allowance — and a 50 000-file first download finishes in one pass in ~141 s. The steady state
  afterwards is 0.6 s per pass at 10 000 files, 8.4 s at 50 000 (one `stat` per file).
- **Interruptions:** a refused batch, a rate-limited window, or a dropped connection now costs one batch
  or one window, not hours. A partially failed bind leaves the unlanded files untracked, so the retry
  re-batches them.

## Remaining work

- **A download's request count.** One content request per file is inherent to content addressing, and it
  is now what bounds a first download (2.8 ms/file at four concurrent files, ~141 s for 50 000). A batch
  content route (N hashes per request) or a higher per-pass concurrency would cut it further; neither is
  needed to _finish_, which is what used to fail.
- **The same measurement on a real network and on mobile.** Everything here is localhost on a desktop;
  the per-batch RTT and the adapter's IPC cost are what a phone makes of the same numbers.
- **A peer that is online during the bind.** Not covered by the numbers above, because the harness
  starts the second device after the first one finished: in the real two-window case the peer receives
  one `file_pushed` per file and used to answer each with its own `POST /sync/pull`. That spent the
  600/minute window on 548 files of 5 000 and left the rest to the next pass. Notifications are now
  coalesced into batched chain pulls (200 per request, 25 ms of holding); see
  [sync-engine.md](sync-engine.md#pass-order-and-concurrency).

## 2026-10-30: per-blob `fsync` removed, batch writes run concurrently

Re-measured on an Apple M1 (macOS 26.6, server on `127.0.0.1`, 5 000 notes of
1–4 KiB, 12.3 MiB): the upload bind took **22.1 s**, and its push phase was the same 22.1 s — every
byte of the gap was the `fsync` in `writePartsAtomic`, one per blob, awaited one file at a time.
A micro-benchmark of the same write pattern measured 4.5 ms per blob with the flush and 0.46 ms
without it.

The store now writes a batch's payloads into **one file** and flushes it **once per push batch**:
the batch appends them, one `fsync` makes the batch durable, and only then do the rows that name
those bytes commit (`docs/blob-files.md` has the layout and the reclaim rule). A flush per blob was
the 22 s; a flush per batch is the 2.5 s.

| 5 000-file bind               |      Push |  Pull |
| ----------------------------- | --------: | ----: |
| before (flush per blob)       |    22.1 s | 3.5 s |
| no flush at all               |     1.9 s | 3.5 s |
| **flush per batch (current)** | **2.5 s** | 3.5 s |

A read resolves the row (one indexed lookup, measured at 0.058 ms per call) and reads the range
with one `pread`, where the old layout derived the path from the hash and opened the file. On this
machine the 5 000-file `many` pull measures 14.7 s (base) against 16.7 s (batch files), and the
churn pull at 500 files is level (1.39 s against 1.42 s). Ruled out as causes: the row lookup
(0.29 s over 5 000 calls), the file layout (a run that wrote one blob per file measured the same
16.6 s pull), and test ordering (reversing the sides did not change the result). The delta scales
with the number of blobs and nothing attributes it yet; it is recorded as an open item rather than
papered over.

What remains is ~0.38 ms per file: the local `stat`/read half (~0.8 s for the vault), encryption,
50 HTTP requests and 50 SQLite commits. The next levers are batch size (100 files / 8 MiB today) and
the per-request fixed cost, not the store.
