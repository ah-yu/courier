/**
 * The community directory's scanner, reproduced for CI.
 *
 * The directory reviews the whole repository with `eslint-plugin-obsidianmd` and a
 * **fixed** ignore list; it does not read this repository's config. A monorepo
 * therefore cannot opt out of that scan, and a non-plugin package can fail the plugin's
 * review — which is exactly what this mirror is for.
 *
 * The directory reports only a known set of Obsidian rules as **Error** (traced from
 * its reviews); everything else it lists, including the typescript-eslint and
 * dependency findings, is a **Warning** and does not fail the review. This config
 * reproduces that split: every rule is a warning except the error set below, so
 * `eslint` exits non-zero exactly when the directory would fail. `bun run lint:review`
 * runs it locally and `bun run verify` runs it as the `review` gate.
 *
 * This file is itself scanned by the directory (its ignore list covers `.mjs`, `.cjs`,
 * `.mts` and `.cts`, not `.ts`), so it is listed in `tsconfig.scripts.json` to keep the
 * type-aware rules resolvable, and it has to stay clean under them.
 *
 * Two things must stay in step with the directory:
 *
 * - the ignore list below (the directory's fixed list, applied by path segment);
 * - the error set (`DIRECTORY_ERROR_RULES`), and the rule set (`obsidianmd.configs
 *   .recommended`, pinned in package.json).
 *
 * See docs/release.md for the review flow and where the list came from.
